# ExcitelCountries
This is a basic app that pulls countries from a single endpoint and later displays in in a ListAdapter. 
There is also local search functionality to filter through the list by name.
Each one of the country views is clickable and leading into a more detailed view.

I have used MVVM design pattern with the addition of repository. 
Key aspects:
Koin Dependency Injection
Mapper ensuring null safety
DataState and no internet handling
